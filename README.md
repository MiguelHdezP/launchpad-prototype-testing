# App configuration

Objective
Goals

Approach, what is the scenario builder.

Diagram of process how it works and people involved, UX, Dev HR and user.


There are three applications:

1.- Scenarios Builder: This application was created to combine different variations in order to help in the conversations to select the scenarios to be tested.

2.- The Dialog with combobox, is the prototype itself to be tested; the combobox will be configured according the querystring.

3.- The prototype launcher: following the same approach I did with other testings, this is the scenarios dashboard for the users.


## Scenarios Builder

### `Adding more data` adding more data

The mock data is in a json file PrintersComboBox/dbprintersDialog/data.json.

The data is consumed through an asyn function called getData that exist in PrintersComboBox/dbprintersDialog/combobox.js, line 3

Note: I'm using a third party script for the combobox, but I added some custome code to the script.

This is the original source of the combobox https://www.zoonman.com/projects/combobox/

The HTMl where the data of the combobox is added is PrintersComboBox/dbprintersDialog/dbprinters.html


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
